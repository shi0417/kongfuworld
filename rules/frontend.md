# Frontend Skill (React + TS)

- Use functional components; avoid complicated state unless needed.
- Use a single source of truth for API calls (services layer if exists).
- Always handle loading/error/empty states.
- Never trust backend strings as HTML unless sanitized.
- For lists: use stable keys, support pagination where dataset can grow.
- For forms: validate before submit and show actionable error messages.
- Keep CSS modular; do not add global CSS unless required.
